This repo serves as my assignment for Intro to Computer Graphics Assignment 1, for the year of 2024, Semester 1.

Acknowledgement of External Assets:
Currently, within the Repo there lies Skybox Assets that are not currently created, motified or otherwise influenced by myself. These assets are the Skybox Space Textures which I use for the skybox.
These assets were found from the Unity Asset Store, and are created and managed by PULSAR BYTES under the Standard Unity Asset Store EULA [https://unity.com/legal/as-terms].
I do not claim these assets as my own, and I hereby acknowledge that these Assets were used to help the style of my Assignment, and as such cannot be used to directly grade me.
These assets were used to create a more imaginative sky for the player, as creating complete skybox textures is beyond the scope that I have set for this assignment.

Part 1 Base:

Currently the scene contains Geometry for the player to move around in.
Coins can be found within the level to collect in order to win.
The Player is fully functional with a sprint.
The scene uses various cel shaded shaders in order to reflect a simple style.

Part 2 Illumination:
The Current Shaders that can be found within the assignment are as follows.
Rimlight, Specular, Toon, Ambient, PBR alongside a few other test Shaders combining different elements from other shaders.

Rimlight Shader was used to distingush the main player from the environment, by giving them a rimlight to stand out from everything else, and bring focus towards your character.

Ambient Shaders were used for the geometry in order to allow them to have an interesting lighting style while allowing them to blend in with each other and not take focus away from the character.

Specular Shaders were used for the coins within the level in order to give them a shine and appearence that would stand out from the environment, without taking too much attention away.
