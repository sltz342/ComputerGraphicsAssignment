This repo serves as my assignment for Intro to Computer Graphics Assignment 1, for the year of 2024, Semester 1.

Acknowledgement of External Assets:
Currently, within the Repo there lies Skybox Assets that are not currently created, motified or otherwise influenced by myself. These assets are the Skybox Space Textures which I use for the skybox.
These assets were found from the Unity Asset Store, and are created and managed by PULSAR BYTES under the Standard Unity Asset Store EULA [https://unity.com/legal/as-terms].
I do not claim these assets as my own, and I hereby acknowledge that these Assets were used to help the style of my Assignment, and as such cannot be used to directly grade me.
These assets were used to create a more imaginative sky for the player, as creating complete skybox textures is beyond the scope that I have set for this assignment.

Within the Repo and Release, there lies assets for glass textures I did not create, nor modify and otherwise are uninfluenced by me. These assets are Glass Window 003 created by Katsukagi on 15/06/2021.
These assets were obtained from 3dtextures.me and I do not claim ownership, nor copyright over them. I used them simply to demonstrate an ideal texture for a surface. You can obtain these textures at (https://3dtextures.me/2021/06/15/glass-window-003/)

Part 1: Improvements:

Currently the scene contains more Geometry for the player to move around in.
Coins can be found within the level to collect in order to win.
The Player is fully functional with a sprint.
The scene uses a rimlight in order to stand out from the environment and the dark area of the game.
Textures are included for the area you start in and the ground, coins and walls are textured via Shaders.

Part 2: Texturing:

The game currently textures all surfaces except for the player object, shaders have normal mapping and are placed in areas that make sense, eg. the ground has a dirtier texture while the walls have a shiny, clear texture.

Ground Textures were created by myself using Krita and Clip Studio Pro

Part 3: Visual Effects:

Using Unity's Particle System, I was able to implement jumping dirt particles and animate them bouncing off the ground too. Each sphere has a unique material that helps bring it out and give it attention without getting in the way of players. I believe this effect is important due to the feedback recieved by the player that their jump action has correctly been inputted via the game, as well as helping with depth perception as the particles will fall and hit ground and collision which can guide a player to the platform without falling.

As well, I created a Lens Flare Visual Effect that gets stronger the more directly you stare at the sun.
I believe this effect is a important part of the game in order to visually demonstrate the stars in the area and to help bring to light how far away you can be from the stars, yet still have light shining on you no matter the darkness you find yourself in.
